# CKEditor 5: wordbreak Plugin (TYPO3 Extension)

## Compatibility

TYPO3 12.4.0 - 12.4.99

## What does this extension do?

- This extension provides general support for the `<wbr>` HTML element in CKEditor 5 and TYPO3 v12
- Editors can insert the element by pressing a button at the current cursor position
- All `<wbr>` elements are highlighted in the editor (similar to the softhyphen)

## `<wbr>`: The Line Break Opportunity element

* Allows a line break **without** adding a hyphen to the wrapped string
* Useful e.g. for long URLs or file paths, displayed on mobile websites or inside narrow parent elements

Line breaks are **only** applied by browsers if the word is too long for the surrounding element or viewport.

The `<wbr>` elements are highlighted with an arrow on a colored background
(similar to the soft-hyphen in TYPO3's editor).

In the frontend, the browser adds line breaks to the text where `<wbr>` elements are set
(but only where necessary).
